# Aerton Industries
Exploring asteroid resources with data analysis, simulations, and open-source research for future space mining.

## Vision
Aerton Industries is an early-stage student-driven initiative with a bold mission:
**to explore and evventually harness the resources of space starting with asteroids.**

While asteroid mining is still a far future endeavor, this repository documents the *first steps* - from simple data analysis and simulations to proof-of-concept projects.

## Current Focus (2025)
- Learning orbital mechanics & asteroid accessibility
- Building small Python tools to explore space data
- Visualizing asteroid datasets (size, orbit, Δv)

## Why this project?
Humanity is on it's way to becoming a Type-I Civilization. But no matter how we choose to harness the full energy potential of our home planet, if we try to it directly on earth, we risk massively heating the planet and potentially making it uninhabitable. At the treshold of becoming a Type-I Civilization, we would be operating at nearly +20°C above today's average global climate. Therefore, it is very likely that we will need to generate energy in space and then deliver it back to Earth.

Furthermore Asteroids contain metals, minerals and volatiles that could power both Earth's economy and potential future space colonies.
